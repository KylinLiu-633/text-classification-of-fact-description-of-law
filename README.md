# Text classification of fact-description of law

This repository is the code of text classification task of fact-description of law in Chinese.

The code was finished in 2017 and without proper reassignment. Sorry for that. We will imporve it as soon as possible.


 - This project aims to research three popular text representation models based on neural network, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec and FastText. 
 - We try to utilize them on the dataset of law case factual description, respectively, in synonym finding task, fine binary-class classification, and fine multi-class classification. According to their performance of these tasks, we can figure out the advantages and disadvantages of them, and learn how to use these models better to solve problems.
 - Besides, this project also try to study how text content and tokenizers affects the text representation. Taking law case factual description as example, we use two different tokenizers, jieba and THULac and make comparison between them. We also manually analyse law case description, and extract different parts of it to make new training data. By training and validate these new dataset, we can know the influence made by text content.

The object and data is totally the same with a contest held in CCF BDCI 2017: http://www.datafountain.cn/#/competitions/277/intro
